This stores 6 variables into t1 through t6 by using addi.
Then it will SLT the first 2 variables and store it in t0.
Then it bne the next variables. Since these are not equal it should skip the next line and go to SLT the last pair of variables. Then it jumps to end and stays in the end loop until the program is stopped.
